# PokéApp

Over the next ~~two days~~ day, you will be building a Pokémon app in **React** using this super neat, super free [PokeApi](https://pokeapi.co/)!

## Here's your mockup:

## Here's your mission:

Build an app that renders the names of the first 151 Pokémon in the pokéapi database on page load. 

## Deliverables


1. Tackle app above with React. Make sure to write clean code, with frequent git commits (we should be able to view the story of building your app based on your commits).

2. Style that puppy and make it look goooooood.

3. Make sure to deploy your app on a platform of your choice.

## Bonus

When the user clicks a name, the app should render information about that Pokémon, including the name and weight.

## Super Bonus

Feeling like a rockstar? Add the Pokémon's abilities to the rendered profile (see mockup above).
